this script will check a directory for duplicate images.  If a duplicate image
is found, it will spit out the names of both images.  This does not do 
recursive directory traversing, it only checks the directory given

Testing:

  python setup.py test

Installation (may require administrative privileges)

  python setup.py install

Usage:

  imgdupcheck /path/to/directory/
